Simulation Calculator – Sugarcane

This tool is an interactive calculator designed to estimate the economic and operational outcomes of sugarcane cultivation under different agricultural and market conditions.
It allows users to input key parameters related to crop price, productivity, area size, treatment strategies, and application intervals. Using these inputs, 
the calculator simulates potential revenues, costs, and returns—making it useful for producers, agronomists, and analysts evaluating treatment decisions or planning crop management.

Key Features

Price Simulation: Input the expected market price per ton of sugarcane and CBIO value.

Productivity Estimation: Calculate outcomes based on expected yield in tons per hectare.

Area-Based Planning: Define the total cultivated area to scale the results.

Corrective Treatment Selection: Choose from standard soil-correction treatments.

Application Configuration: Set treatment dosage (t/ha) and application interval (years).

Interactive Output: Generate projections to support decision-making for soil management and economic planning in sugarcane production.

This calculator provides a practical and intuitive interface for simulating financial impacts and optimizing field management strategies in sugarcane farming.
